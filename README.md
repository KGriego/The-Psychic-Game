# The-Psychic-Game

The Psychic Game picks a word from a predetermined list, at random, for the user to guess. The user inputs guesses one letter at a time via key press. The game is similar to Hangman.

The game accepts user input in the form of key press of any alphabet character (a-z). Special characters and numbers are acceptable, but not included. So be careful. It will display how many guesses are remaining and which letters have already been guessed.
